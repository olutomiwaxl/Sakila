-- Using the tables payment and customer and the JOIN command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:





-- The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters K and Q have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters K and Q whose language is English.
